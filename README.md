# R_Analysis
Learn how to use R and statistics  in order to analyze vehicle data.

## Module Overview
In this module, you’ll apply your understanding of statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry. Your analysis will include visualizations, statistical tests, and interpretation of the results. All of your statistical analysis and visualizations will be written in the R programming language.

## Project Overview
In this challenge, you’ll perform a series of statistical tests and create a technical report that provides your interpretation of the findings.

The goals for this challenge are to:
1. Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
2. Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
3. Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
4. Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.
